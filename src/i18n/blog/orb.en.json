      "content": "The opening range is the high and low price established during the first hour (or first 30 minutes) of trading. This range is significant because it represents the initial battle between buyers and sellers after the market opens. The first hour often sets the tone for the day, making it a critical period for traders."

If the breakout fails and price returns inside the range, you exit. This creates a clear risk-reward setup where your risk is defined by the range size."
