      "heading": "The Challenge Fee Trap",
      "content": "Most prop firms charge an upfront fee for their challenges—typically $50 to $500 or more. What many traders don't realize is that if you fail the challenge, you lose this fee entirely. Some firms offer \"retakes\" at a discount, but these costs add up quickly. After multiple failed attempts, you could spend thousands before ever getting funded."

    "profitSplitReality": {
      "heading": "The Profit Split Reality",
      "content": "Even when you pass the challenge and get funded, prop firms take a significant cut of your profits—typically 50% to 80%. This means if you make $10,000, you might only see $2,000 to $5,000. When you factor in all the fees and the profit split, the effective cost of trading with prop firms can be much higher than advertised."
    },
    "unrealisticProfitTargets": {
      "heading": "Unrealistic Profit Targets",
      "content": "Many prop firm challenges require you to hit profit targets within strict timeframes—often 8% to 10% in 30 days. While this sounds achievable, it's actually an aggressive target that forces traders to take excessive risk. This pressure often leads to overtrading and poor decision-making, which is exactly what the prop firm wants—they profit from your failures."

    "trueCostCalculation": {
      "heading": "The True Cost Calculation",
      "content": "Let's say you pay $300 for a challenge and fail three times before passing. That's $900 in challenge fees. Then you pay $100/month in platform and data fees. After a year, you've spent $2,100 just to trade. If you make $20,000 in profits but the firm takes 70%, you keep $6,000. Your net profit is $3,900—but you've also spent countless hours and emotional energy."

      "heading": "Better Alternatives",
      "content": "Instead of paying prop firms for the privilege of trading their capital, consider alternatives that give you more control and better economics. With proven strategies and proper risk management, you can build your own trading account without the hidden costs and restrictions of prop firms."
